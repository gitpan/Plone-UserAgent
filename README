NAME
    Plone::UserAgent - An LWP agent with "logging into Plone" built-in

SYNOPSIS
        use Plone::UserAgent;

        my $ua =
            Plone::UserAgent->new
                ( username => 'foo',
                  password => 'bar',
                  base_uri => 'http://my.plone.site.example.com',
                );

        $ua->login();

        my $page_uri = $ua->make_uri( '/some/page' );

        my $response = $ua->get($page_uri);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a fairly trivial subclass of LWP::UserAgent that knows
    how to log in to a Plone site. It's been tested with 3.2.2.

    Patches are welcome to add additional Plone-specific features (as long
    as they're nice patches, not gross, ugly patches).

METHODS
    This class provides these methods;

Plone::UserAgent->new( ... )
    This method creates a new user agent object.

    The constructor accepts the following parameters:

    * base_uri
        The root URI of your Plone site. required.

    * username
        The username to use when logging in to the site. required, but see
        below.

    * password
        The username to use when logging in to the site. required, but see
        below.

    * config_file
        An optional config file. This should be an INI config file. All that
        is expected to be in the file is a username and password, with no
        section header:

          username = foo
          password = bar

        This defaults to $HOME/.plone-useragentrc.

    The constructor requires a username and password, but if you don't pass
    these , it will try to look them up the config file.

  $ua->login()
    Attempts to log in to the site. Throws an error if it fails.

  $ua->make_uri($path)
    Given a path, returns a URI based on the `base_uri' passed to the
    constructor. This is provided for convenience since it's used
    internally.

DONATIONS
    If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
    consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free
    time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care
    to offer.

    Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
    me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to
    do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

    Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on
    this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
    consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
    best.

    To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
